speaker_0: and oil light ok okay and uh just for clarity on my end ma'am am is this the first call you've made regarding this
speaker_1: yes
speaker_0: okay and h uh this might be kind of a silly question 'cause i you just got the car but sometimes they make me ask silly questions about how many miles has the car been driven since you bought it
speaker_1: oh i'm not sure should i check
speaker_0: ah no that's okay i'll just i'll just put in that we don't know at this time it's okay um okay so um under the warranty we offer um we the we don't handle in house oil changes um we basically when when someone buys a car from us the warranty we have it it covers some stuff like weather damage and h if the engine light comes on we take a look at that but the oil change is something that we just don't have ah here at the dealership that's a little bit outsourced out and they're pretty backed up right now because a lot of people have been staying in due to the recent pandemic and now everyone's just starting to get out and a whole bunch of places are just completely bogged down so we have a place that we typically outsourc to and they're they're pretty reasonable they're about i want to say somewhere between twenty five and thirty five dollars to do an oil change so it's really not that bad but they're a little bit backed up right now from what i've heard i would recommend giving them a call as soon as you can before they close
speaker_1: ok what is their number
speaker_0: give me a and let me just rustle through the desk here see if i can find their uh information uh okay okay yes all right with them
speaker_1: one moment please sure okay
speaker_0: all right their number is eight eight three three three two two two two
speaker_1: ok and they can fix my car
speaker_0: yah they should be able to handle the oil change i'm sorry that's not something that we cover under the warranty that uh we have um but they should be able to get you settled and uh sorted okay
speaker_1: ok thank you
speaker_0: no problem have a good one
speaker_1: thank youy
